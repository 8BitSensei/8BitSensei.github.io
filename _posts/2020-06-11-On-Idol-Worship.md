I've recently finished reading Philip Kiernan's 'Roman Cult Images: The Lives and Worship of Idols from the Iron Age to Late Antiquity'. The book seeks to address the history of Idols in the Iron Age to Late Antiquity, the area of study is largely limited to Western Europe with comparisons further abroad, this is no surprise as Kiernan specialises in the North-Western Roman provinces having published on the topic before.

Throughout the book Kiernan is able to bring about a rough definition of what an idol is, as opposed to any other object, or some other form of religious imagery, and how we might go about identifying idols in the archaeological record.

## Iconism vs Aniconism

## Agency and Relationships

## It's an idol if we treat it like one

## Spaces dedicated to the idols
