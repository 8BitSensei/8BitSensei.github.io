  role: Platform Engineer
  duration: 2019 &mdash; Present
  # url: "#"
  description: At Mythical UK I've been lucky enough to see and work on the development of what we call 'Command Streaming', you can hear more about that and how it is a major improvement on regular streaming technologies and how we leverage cloud technologies <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuGIa0XvR6Y">here</a>. As a Platform Engineer I have been working on the global infrastructure that enables Command Streaming to be available to customers and developers, rather than the core technology.

  role: Platform Engineer - Mythical UK
  duration: 2022 &mdash; Present

  description: We recently completely overhauled the way we deliver the Polystream streaming experience to use a container based approach, not only did this mean re-working our Platform Services, it also meant re-designing how developers publish their applications onto our platform. Because we are going with a container based approach, we decided to use OCI artefacts as application packages, and develop a tool, mythctl in Go, based on the Docker CLI that would use our OCI compliant asset-spec to build and push artefacts to compatible registries for streaming.

- project: PPU
  role: Platform Engineer - Mythical UK
  duration: 2021 &mdash; Present
  # url: "#"
  description: While at Mythical UK one of the major challenges that faced us was how to easily get an Application such as Unity Editor or Alien Isolation from a developer to the Polystream platform so that it could be streamed globally. In 2021 I took the lead in developing a CLI tool called PPU (Polystream Packaging Utility) aimed at making the process of packaging and publishing an application to Polystream simple and recognisable for developers. You can read about some of the challenges I faced and the outcomes <a href="https://polystream.com/developing-in-house-tools-the-polystream-ppu/">here</a>.

- project: Templum - hobby project
  duration: 2021 &mdash; Present
  # url: "#"
  description: Templum is a hobby-project of mine that I work on to improve some of my web skills while indulging my interests in History and Archaeology. Templum is a searchable catalogue of Temple sites from Britain and Ireland between 100 BCE and 600 CE. I'm currently overhauling it to use a .NET based backend that will <a href="https://github.com/8BitSensei/gitrows-dotnet">use Github as a no-SQL database</a> based on the <a href="https://gitrows.com/">Gitrows</a> project.  You can check it out <a href="https://8bitsensei.github.io/Templum/">here</a>.

- project: Virtual Museum
  role: Platform Engineer - Mythical UK
  duration: 2020
  # url: "#"
  description: At Mythical UK we held regular 'Fantom Jams', a hackathon type event where in small teams we were able to experiment with our streaming technologies to our heart's content over a 48 hour period and attempt to 'do something amazing'. In Spring 2021 myself and a team of 3 other Polystreamers re-created a virtual museum space in the Unity Editor to show off some of Polystream's history and show that these virtual spaces aren't limited to traditional games experiences, but more social and even educational experiences too. We came in first place! You can read more about it <a href="https://polystream.com/polystream-jam-spring-edition/">here</a>. ðŸ¥‡
