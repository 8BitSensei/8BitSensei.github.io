- skill: üë®‚Äçüíª C#, .NET Core, and Go
  duration: 5 Years
  description: I have been working with C# and .NET since I graduated from the University of Surrey and started working at Streeva in 2018, currently my day-to-day are primarily in .NET 6.0 and C# 10. All of the services I have worked on over the past 5 years have primarily been written using these tools and aim to achieve a Test-first programming approach using popular packages such as XUnit, FluentAssertions, and NSubstitute. Over the past year I have also been increasingly using Go in the workplace, re-working internal tooling from the ground up using Go 1.20.

- skill: ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Services
  duration: 5 Years
  description: I've been working with Cloud Services for 5 years now. At Streeva, I developed Azure Functions to form our API, backed by Azure Storage. At Mythical UK (formerly Polystream) I work with GCP and Kubernetes to manage our Platform Services across multiple Nodes, as well as Azure, primarily for Storage, Functions, and in the past DevOps, and AWS to deploy EC2 instances to host and serve command-streamed games. At Mythical UK we aim to provide a 'cloud-agnostic' streaming service as an alternative to traditional streaming services, so I have had experience architecting, deploying and managing Platform Services on a global scale. </br></br> In March 2021 a team of four Polystreamers including myself took part in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/gameday/">AWS Game Day event</a> and came third place out of eleven teams! ü•â </br></br> I am a certified AWS Cloud Practitioner (Jan 2022 - Jan 2025).

- skill: üê≥ Docker and Kubernetes

  description: At Mythical UK I use combination of Kubernetes and Docker to deploy and manage multiple Nodes of containerised Platform Services, and Lens for observation. Recently I have worked on a customised OCI compliant image-spec with the addition specifically for containerised Games, along with our own internal tool written in Go for managing application artifacts based on the Docker CLI.
